## 📱 Android Setup Requirements (CRITICAL for Drivers)

### Installation Steps:
1. **Install as PWA**: Chrome → Menu → "Add to Home Screen"
2. **Location Permission**: Settings → Apps → Chrome → Location → "Allow all the time"
3. **Battery Optimization**: Settings → Apps → Chrome → Battery → "Don't optimize"
4. **GPS Accuracy**: Settings → Location → "High accuracy" mode
5. **Notifications**: Enable for tracking status updates

### Device-Specific:
- **Samsung**: Add to "Never sleeping apps"
- **Xiaomi/MIUI**: Set "No restrictions" in battery saver
- **All devices**: Keep app in foreground for best results

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Current Status:
- ✅ Code is production-ready
- ✅ All features fully implemented
- ✅ No simulations or placeholders
- ✅ MongoDB configured
- ✅ Vercel configuration fixed

### Deploy to Vercel:

```bash
# Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Production-ready with enhanced Android tracking"
git push origin main
```

### In Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to your project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add: `MONGODB_URI` = `mongodb+srv://muhammednihal24ag039:l6ZrDiiOk3TY74aV@cluster0.pppmmcf.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0`
3. Select all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
4. Save and redeploy

## 📊 Features Breakdown

### Location Tracking Accuracy:
- **Update Frequency**: Every 3 seconds
- **GPS Mode**: High accuracy (uses GPS, WiFi, cellular)
- **Speed Calculation**: Dual method (GPS speed + calculated from position)
- **Heading**: Calculated from movement direction
- **Minimum Distance**: 5 meters (prevents stationary spam)

### Background Tracking (Best Effort):
- Wake Lock keeps screen on
- Service Worker maintains connection
- Visibility API handles app backgrounding
- Works best when app is in foreground
- Android limitations: Some devices may pause after screen lock

### Battery Optimization:
- Efficient location updates (only when moving)
- Cached API responses
- Minimal UI redraws
- Network-first API strategy
- Auto-cleanup of stale data (10 min timeout)

## 🔧 Technical Stack

### Frontend:
- Pure JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Leaflet.js for mapping
- Service Worker API
- Geolocation API
- Wake Lock API
- Notification API
- IndexedDB for offline storage

### Backend:
- Node.js serverless functions
- MongoDB Atlas (cloud database)
- Vercel hosting
- Real-time data sync

### APIs:
- `POST /api/location` - Update bus location
- `GET /api/location` - Get all active buses
- `DELETE /api/location` - Remove bus
- `POST /api/buses` - Register bus
- `GET /api/buses` - List registered buses
- `GET /api/routes` - List routes

## 📝 Known Limitations & Workarounds

### 1. Android Battery Optimization
**Issue**: Some Android devices aggressively kill background apps
**Workaround**: 
- Disable battery optimization
- Keep app in foreground
- Physical button press every 10-15 min on some devices

### 2. Screen Lock Tracking
**Issue**: GPS may stop when screen locks on some devices
**Workaround**:
- Wake Lock keeps screen on (but dims)
- Connect to vehicle USB charger
- Some devices need "Location always" + "Physical activity" permissions

### 3. Browser vs PWA
**Issue**: Chrome browser may be more restricted than PWA
**Solution**: Install as PWA (Add to Home Screen) for better performance

### 4. Network Connectivity
**Issue**: Rural areas may have poor 4G
**Solution**: 
- Offline queue with IndexedDB
- Background sync when network returns
- Retry logic in Service Worker

## 🎯 Best Practices for Deployment

### Pre-Launch:
1. ✅ Test on multiple Android devices
2. ✅ Verify MongoDB connection
3. ✅ Test in low network conditions
4. ✅ Check battery drain over 1-hour period
5. ✅ Verify map markers update correctly

### Post-Launch:
1. Monitor MongoDB usage (stay within free tier: 512MB)
2. Check Vercel bandwidth usage
3. Collect driver feedback on tracking accuracy
4. Monitor error logs in Vercel dashboard
5. Consider upgrading to paid plans if needed

### Training Drivers:
1. Provide `ANDROID_SETUP.md` to all drivers
2. Conduct hands-on training session
3. Test tracking during depot parking
4. Verify first trip before regular service
5. Provide support contact for issues

## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

See `ANDROID_SETUP.md` for detailed troubleshooting guide.

### Quick Fixes:
- **Not tracking**: Check location permissions + GPS enabled
- **Stops after lock**: Disable battery optimization
- **High battery drain**: Normal for continuous GPS, connect to charger
- **No updates on map**: Check driver's mobile data connection
- **Deployment errors**: Verify MongoDB URI in Vercel env variables
