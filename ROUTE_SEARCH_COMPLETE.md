function filterBusesByRoute(buses, searchTerm) {
  // Matches:
  // - Route numbers (IRT-TLY-001)
  // - Route names (Iritty to Thalassery)
  // - City names (Kannur, KNR)
  // - Partial matches
}

// Search handler
searchBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  filteredRoute = routeSearchInput.value;
  fetchBuses(); // Re-fetch and filter
});
```

### Backend Updates
```javascript
// API now stores:
- routeNumber: "IRT-TLY-001"
- routeName: "Iritty to Thalassery"

// Both searchable from frontend
```

### UI Enhancements
```html
<!-- Search input -->
<input id="routeSearch" placeholder="Search by route...">
