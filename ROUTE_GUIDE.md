# üõ£Ô∏è KSRTC Route Information Guide

## Route Search Feature

The KSRTC Bus Tracker now includes a powerful route search feature that allows passengers to find buses by route information.

## How to Search for Buses by Route

### 1. **Search by Route Number**
Enter the route code/number directly:
```
Examples:
- TVM-EKM-001
- KNR-TLY-045
- KCH-TRS-123
```

### 2. **Search by Route Name**
Enter the origin and destination:
```
Examples:
- Iritty to Thalassery
- Thiruvananthapuram to Kochi
- Kannur to Kozhikode
- TVM to EKM
```

### 3. **Partial Matches**
Search works with partial route information:
```
Examples:
- "Iritty" - finds all buses from/to Iritty
- "Thalassery" - finds all buses from/to Thalassery
- "TVM-EKM" - finds all buses on TVM-EKM route
```

5. Clear filter and try again

### Route not showing in search
**Driver Action Required:**
1. Ensure route number is entered correctly
2. Add route name in driver app
3. Format should match standards
4. Restart tracking if route info changed
